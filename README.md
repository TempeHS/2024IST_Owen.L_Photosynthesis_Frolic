**Photosynthisis** **Frolic** was a concept originally created by my multimedia partner **Van.** This was orignally supposed to be a 2D platformer pve game where would would get many different power ups. The audience for the game is Teens to provide a fast paced challange. While not the exact same as the original idea the core concepts were still implemented

### Game Objectives
- **Coins**: Collect all the coins while avoiding the Wasps.
- **Levels**: The game has two levels. One Intro Duction and One Full Level
- **Monsters**: Dodge Wasps and Ranged Enemys(i was never given a sprite or animations for the ranged enemy)
- **Goal**: Complete both of the levels by collecting all ten coinswhile dodging Wasps and Ranged Enemies. After collecting all the coins and reaching the final checkpoint you would go to a win screen and then go back to the main menu where you can quit or play again
